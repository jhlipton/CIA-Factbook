# CIA-Factbook
Information based on the CIA Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/)

The data was originally loaded from "The World Factbook": https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases

However, I noticed that population_growth and migration_rate did not have any negative values.  I downloaded the correct data from the CIA website (population growth(https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html#ic) and migration rates (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2112.html#ic) and reset these fields accordingly.  The updated database is here in factbook.db.

I'll have more notes later...
